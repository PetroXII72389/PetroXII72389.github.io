    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We restarted and started to build a new blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To construct a fully functioning new blog on github without any help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes as this is the blog and whilst it is still rather basic it works which was the point of the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Because we weren't aloud help from other people I only used two techniques, or at least mostly used only two techniques: looking up on google the things I didn’t know and trial and error - if I committed to one thing I could almost always get it to work eventually even if I didn’t fully understand it as just trying again and again (plus a fair bit of google tutorials) normally meant it worked eventually.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Little specifically hampered my learning other than the most obvious problems of the fact that I am not that good at coding and wasn’t allowed help from the teacher as we were meant to do it on our own but this wasn’t too bad and I did clearly manage to get past it because, although basic, I do have a functioning blog which I can now post onto as I am now.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In regard to actually changing strategy I don’t think I will do that much different next lesson but I will start to try more complicated coding to produce a proper blog which will be harder and so I may have to resort to getting help, but I will try to avoid this as I am trying to complete the task on my own.</td>
