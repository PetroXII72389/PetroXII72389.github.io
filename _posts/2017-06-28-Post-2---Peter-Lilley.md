    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had constructed a basic blog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>This lesson we created a system on repl.it that collects and then verifies a username and password using Python3.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, as I managed to create a fully functioning system that carried out this task and then remade it using more concise code</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I mostly just used trial and error but it seemed to mostly been error as I hadn't used Python3 for nearly half a year. I got around the problem that I had forgotten most of it by looking back at the previous systems I had made and taking bits of code from one project into another and used this to check for issues with my code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was that I had forgotten most of what we had learnt in regard to Python3 coding and as a result of this I, initially at least, struggled to carry out some incredibly simple tasks for example simply asking for your name and then returning the response.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson should be a whole lot easier as I now have a much better understanding of Python3 coding so wonâ€™t make as many mistakes. Other than that I plan to employ similar strategies just take advantage of my more thorough understanding. Although I am yet to create code that worked first time.</td>
