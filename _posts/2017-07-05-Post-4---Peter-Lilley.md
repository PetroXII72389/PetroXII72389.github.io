<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had learned some basic Python3 code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>This week we sailed to simply do some more complicated Python3 coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, as I managed to create a code to convert metric and imperial system and carry out basic mathematics</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Lesson Review</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Basically the same as last week just by repeated trial and error although, again, mostly error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Again, I had a major limit in regard to Python3 knowledge but generally I could solve all the problems I came across.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly just continue to build up and practice Python3 knowledge as this is the main thing holding me back but not much else.</td>
  </tr>
