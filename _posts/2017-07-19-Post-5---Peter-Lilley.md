  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Done some more complicated Python3 coding</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>We continued to do some Python3 problems</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Somewhat as I did manage to improve my program but didn't quite have time to finish</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>This week I hardly used trial and error as I am beginning to pick up a better understanding of Python3 meaning I can actually rely on my own knowledge more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week the only thing that really held me back was a lack of spare time as I had only one hour to complete a fairly long program (96 lines of code).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I plan to do some at home to prepare for next lesson so I can be more time efficient and be able to finish my current program.</td>
